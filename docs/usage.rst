Usage
=====

Due to the lack of funding support, only limited documentation has been developed.
Despite the funding difficulties, we provide various examples extend from simple demo to complex research
project under `<root>/examples <https://github.com/hong-chen/er3t/tree/dev/examples>`_ and hope users can learn
the usage of EaRÂ³T from example.


Examples (`code status <https://discord.com/channels/681619528945500252/1004090233412923544/1017575066139103293>`_)

**The example code is under active development. Please check for the latest code status before use.**

Additionally, these example codes require auxiliary data to run.
To download the required data, under the example directory (``<root>/examples``) where it contains ``install-examples.sh``,
type in the following

::

    bash install-examples.sh

|

    If ``install-examples.sh`` fails to download the data from Google Drive for any reason, you can download the required data manually
    from `here <https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Oov75VffmuQSljxjoOS6q6egmfT6CmkI/view?usp=share_link>`_.

    After you download the file (``er3t-data-examples.tar.gz``), put it under ``<root>/examples`` directory where
    it contains ``install-examples.sh``, then run the command ``bash install-examples.sh`` through a terminal again.

|

Codes ``00`` (e.g., ``<root>/examples/00_er3t_mca.py``) can be used to perform test runs.

Codes ``01`` to ``04`` can be used to reproduce scientific results discussed in
`Chen et al. (2023) <https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-16-1971-2023>`_.

The figure results for each example are provided in ``check`` directory (available after installing auxiliary data)
for validation.
