Documentation
-------------

The documentation is written in `reStructuredText <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/index.html>`_
format (also known as ``.rst`` files) and compiled using `Sphinx <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/>`_ software.
The most up-to-date documentation source code is available at `er3t/gh-pages <https://github.com/hong-chen/er3t/tree/gh-pages>`_
branch and hosted by `Read the Docs <https://readthedocs.org>`_.


Once new changes are pushed to `er3t/gh-pages`_, `Read the Docs`_ will automatically compile the documentation on the
cloud server, where the changes can be reflected on this documentation site shortly if compilation process is successful.
