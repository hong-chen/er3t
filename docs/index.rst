The Education and Research 3D Radiative Transfer Toolbox (EaR³T, /ɜːt/) is a Python software package
designed for radiative transfer and remote sensing applications. It provides high-level interfaces
to automate the process of performing IPA/3D radiative transfer calculations for measured
or modeled cloud/aerosol fields using publicly available IPA/3D radiative transfer models
including MCARaTS, libRadtran (IPA only), and SHDOM (under development).

The code is publicly available at https://github.com/hong-chen/er3t.


**Applications:**

* Spaceborne and airborne remote sensing;

* 3D radiative effects (of clouds, aerosols, and trace gases etc.);

* Synthetic data generation (for CNN training);

* Novel retrieval algorithm development (e.g., CNN-based).


**Contributors:**

EaR³T was originally designed and developed by `Hong Chen <hong.chen@lasp.colorado.edu>`_ and
`Sebastian Schmidt <sebastian.schmidt@lasp.colorado.edu>`_ at the University of Colorado Boulder
and `Hong Chen <hong.chen@lasp.colorado.edu>`_ is the current maintainer.

Additionally, EaR³T has been actively contributed by the following developers:

* `Vikas Nataraja <Vikas.HanasogeNataraja@lasp.colorado.edu>`_ (Dec., 2022 - current)

* `Ken Hirata <Ken.Hirata@colorado.edu>`_ (Jan., 2023 - current)
