EaR³T (pronounced [ɜːt]) provides high-level interfaces that can automate the process of performing IPA/3D
radiative transfer calculations for measured or modeled cloud/aerosol fields using
publicly available IPA/3D radiative transfer models including MCARaTS (**implemented**),
libRadtran (**implemented**, IPA only), and SHDOM (under development).

Applicable area:

* Spaceborne and airborne remote sensing;

* 3D radiative effects (of clouds, aerosols, and trace gases etc.);

* Synthetic data generation (for CNN training);

* Novel retrieval algorithm development (e.g., CNN-based).


.. note::

    This documentation is under active development.
