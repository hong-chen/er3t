The Education and Research 3D Radiative Transfer Toolbox (EaR³T, /ɜːt/) is a Python software package
developed for cutting-edge radiative transfer and remote sensing applications. It provides high-level
interfaces to automate the process of performing IPA/3D radiative transfer calculations for measured
or modeled cloud/aerosol fields using publicly available IPA/3D radiative transfer models
including MCARaTS, libRadtran (IPA only), and SHDOM (under development).

Applications
------------

* Spaceborne and airborne remote sensing;

* 3D radiative effects (of clouds, aerosols, and trace gases etc.);

* Synthetic data generation (for CNN training);

* Novel retrieval algorithm development (e.g., CNN-based).
